# Houdini Node Inspector

This is toolset for gathering information from the node in covnenient form.
I have been using a lot of it's uctionality in my Houdini TD work but every time i had to rewrite the same functionality.
Do I decided to make a swiss-knofe-style toolset for quickly getting info from the node like:
  - Get all parameter names
  - Get all parameter labels
  - Get user data
  - Quickly convert parameters to class-properties
  - Get callbacks
  - Get conditionals
  - Explode HDA to subnetwork
  - etc

## Current State 

Right now this is just a skeleton of fututre toolset.
I implemented PySide2 interface (i think a lot of things from here would be helpful to people learning PySide/PyQt).
This should take to long to finish and can be useful on any stage of development
